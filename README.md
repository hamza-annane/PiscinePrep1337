## Key Additions to the Plan
- **Debugging & Tools**: Learn `gdb` and `valgrind` to catch memory issues early.  
- **Basic Algorithms**: Implement foundational algorithms to improve problem-solving.  
- **Modular Code**: Split code into headers and source files for better organization.  
- **Project Integration**: Combine all concepts into a cohesive project with a `Makefile`.
