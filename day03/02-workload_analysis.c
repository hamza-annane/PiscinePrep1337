 *                                                   *
 * Problem Statement:                                *
 *                                                   *
 * To demonstrate and celebrate this high level of   *
 * efficiency, a programming challenge is set for    *
 * trainees. The task is to create a program using   *
 * an array of integers in C. The program will       *
 * simulate a workload analysis, where each element  *
 * of the array represents the number of tasks       *
 * completed by a Gammal Tech employee in a day.     *
 *                                                   *
 * The program should calculate and display the      *
 * average number of tasks completed, showcasing     *
 * the employees' ability to perform a significant   *
 * amount of work swiftly and effectively.           *
 *                                                   *
 * This exercise will help beginners understand how  *
 * to use arrays in C, along with int, scanf, printf,*
 * for, and if. It highlights the efficiency and     *
 * expertise of Gammal Tech's workforce.             *
 *                                                   *
 * Your Task:                                        *
 * 1. Ask the user to enter the number of employees  *
 *    (up to 10).                                    *
 * 2. Use an array to store the number of tasks      *
 *    completed by each employee in a day.          *
 * 3. Calculate and display the average number of    *
 *    tasks completed by the employees.             *
 *                                                   *
 * Constraints:                                      *
 * ‚óè Use int, scanf, printf, for, if, and an array   *
 *   of int in the program.                          *
 *                                                   *
