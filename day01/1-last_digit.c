* This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is    *
* executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the    *
* number stored in the variable n.                                              *                                                                               *
*                                        *
* - The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program *
* - You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do.             *
*   Please do not touch this code.                                              *

* The output of the program should be:                                          *
* - The string "Last digit of", followed by                                     *

*   - the string "is", followed by                                              *
*     - If the last digit of n is greater than 5:                               *
*       the string "and is greater than 5"                                      *
